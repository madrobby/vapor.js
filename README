vapor.js is a new amazing JavaScript framework.

In just 0 lines of code it provides:


Usage: 

<script src="vapor.js"></script>

On modern browsers, you can inline it with a data URL:

<script></script>

(In this case, you can also omit the <script> tag completely for the ultimate in optimizations and efficiency!)
