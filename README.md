# vapor.js is a new amazing JavaScript framework.

In just 0 lines of code it provides:

## Usage: 
```html
<script src="vapor.js"></script>
```

On modern browsers, you can inline it with a data URL:

```html
<script src="data:application/javascript,"></script>
```

Alternatively, inline the whole code, like this:

```html
<script></script>
```

(In this case, you can also omit the `<script>` tag completely for the ultimate in optimizations and efficiency!)
